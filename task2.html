                <h1>Biography : </h1>
              <p>Elon Musk, (born June 28, 1971, Pretoria, South Africa), South African-born American entrepreneur who cofounded the electronic-payment firm PayPal and formed SpaceX, maker of launch vehicles and spacecraft. He was also one of the first significant investors in, as well as chief executive officer of, 

                    the electric car manufacturer Tesla. In addition, Musk acquired Twitter in 2022.</p>

                <h2>Some intersing things of his life :</h2>

                <li> He invented a game</li>

                <p>

                    Elon Musk created and sold a video game to a magazine when he was 12 years old.

                     ‘Blastar,’ a space fighting game, was sold for $500 to PC and

                     Office Technology magazine. Musk also worked for ‘Rocket Science,’ a gaming start-up.

                <li> Musk almost sold Tesla to Google</li>

                <p>

                    According to Ashlee Vance, author of Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX,and the Quest for a Fantastic

                     Future, Musk almost sold Tesla to Google for $11 billion in 2013. 

                     Tesla’s future looked bleak at the time, so Musk approached Larry Page, Google’s co-founder and CEO, for a takeover.

                      Musk proposed that Google purchase Tesla for $6 billion, with Musk promising to invest another $5 billion in factory expansion. Musk also demanded that Page hand over control of Tesla to him for the next eight years. The deal came to a halt at the eleventh hour when the sales of Model S, an all-electric five-door liftback produced by Tesla,

                     Inc began to pick up. Tesla is expected to be worth around $100 billion by 2020.
